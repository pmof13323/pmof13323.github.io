In our student project, a text based dungeon crawler game, I collaborated with two team members to create a game with a simple yet captivating story. We incorporated dynamic health bars for players and enemies, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. The highlight was our dynamic inventory system, giving characters the ability to manage their gear and resources on the go. Although it's a student project, we aimed to deliver an enjoyable experience, blending a modest narrative with engaging gameplay features to create a fun and interactive dungeon exploration game.

Throughout this project, my primary focus and learning emphasis revolved around pointers and object-oriented programming (OOP), which served as the foundational building blocks for implementing dynamic game systems. Working extensively with pointers enhanced my understanding of memory management, allowing me to create flexible and efficient data structures. Embracing OOP principles enabled me to design modular and extensible components, contributing to the development of dynamic health bars, inventory systems, and other essential features within our dungeon crawler. The hands-on experience in applying these concepts not only bolstered my programming skills but also provided valuable insights into creating scalable and maintainable game architectures.
