From a young age I was fascinated by photography, finding myself taking photos of anything from my parents to our neighbour's wooden gates. In the past 3 years I've gained a deep appreciation for the art of film photography, particularly 35mm coloured film. Using my grandfather's old camera, I've embarked on a journey to capture moments that resonate with a timeless charm, embracing the unique quality and authenticity that only film photography can provide. This exploration into 35mm colored film has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of light, composition, and storytelling, allowing me to create images that evoke emotions and tell stories. The manual nature of film photography has taught me patience and attention to detail. 

I've created a portfolio to explore this passion further and share my photos with the world, and it can be found on @suitsandsaltwater on instagram. Why "suits and saltwater"? Because I love taking photos of everything from suits and concrete jungles to salty oceans and natural landscapes.
