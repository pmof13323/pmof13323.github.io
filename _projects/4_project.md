Welcome to my 2020 Spotify music dashboard which was my first project in the world of data science. Developed as a fun and educational venture, this project revolved around constructing an interactive data dashboard using 2020's top music chart data. The dashboard is accessible at musicdash.streamlit.app. The main focus of this project was the exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a fascinating domain of data science that I've delved into to decipher patterns and trends in popular music. Through this dashboard, I've ventured into basic NLP concepts like text processing, tokenisation, stemming, lemmatisation and have undertaken sentiment analysis on song titles to capture the emotional essence of popular tracks. Additionally, this project has been an opportunity to experiment with text classification techniques, aiming to categorize songs by their genre or mood. This project was powered by Python and the user-friendly Streamlit framework.  I'm open to ideas, feedback, and collaboration from fellow enthusiasts. Stay tuned for more updates as this project continues to evolve!

Delving into sentiment analysis has been a truly fascinating experience, uncovering the subtle emotional undercurrents hidden within the simple titles of songs/

Finding insights in the data based on music popularity and its correlation with musical characteristics was fascinating and a rich learning experience. Some of the insights found can be seen below.

Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of NLP techniques, and learned concepts like text processing, tokenisation, and sentiment analysis to reveal the emotional and thematic trends in music. Additionally, I've honed my skills in data visualisation and interactive dashboard creation using Python and Streamlit, effectively translating complex data insights into user-friendly formats.
