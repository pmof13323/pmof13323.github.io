Meet the All Environment Explorer (AEE), an amphibious drone created from the collaborative efforts of our team. This cutting-edge drone is capable of seamlessly travelling on roads, floating on water, and taking flight in the air. This robot was designed to eventually offer unparalleled versatility for tasks ranging from environmental monitoring to search-and-rescue missions. The AEE's tri-functional design, supported by robust propulsion systems was developed with the sponsorship of Adept Adelaide. This drone represents a harmonious blend of academic knowledge and practical skills.

In the All Environment Explorer project, I honed my leadership skills by steering a diverse team through the challenges of conceptualising, designing, and building a multifaceted drone. As the project lead, I facilitated collaboration, delegated tasks, and maintained a cohesive vision. On the technical front, my software engineering proficiency was sharpened as I oversaw the development of the AEE's autonomous navigation system, ensuring seamless transitions between road, water, and air modes. Simultaneously, I deepened my understanding of electrical and mechanical systems, overseeing the integration of propulsion mechanisms and refining the AEE's overall functionality. This holistic experience not only elevated the project's success but also significantly contributed to my growth across multiple engineering domains.
