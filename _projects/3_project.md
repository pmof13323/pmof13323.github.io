In our venture into the Warman competition, my team and I embarked on the exciting challenge of developing a robot tailored for the competition's requirements. My primary responsibility in this project centered around the design of a pivotal pulley system crucial for transporting the robot from the ball pickup point (A) to the ball drop-off point (B). I crafted a mechanism featuring carefully implemented bearings and a motor intricately attached to a string with three points of contact. This innovative approach utilised tension and friction to facilitate smooth and efficient movement, ensuring our robot navigates the competition terrain with precision and effectiveness.

Designing the pulley system for the Warman competition proved to be an invaluable learning experience for me. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of mechanical engineering principles, particularly in the application of bearings, motors, and tension control. Navigating the intricacies of the competition's requirements honed my problem-solving skills, challenging me to find optimal solutions for the robot's transportation mechanism. Collaborating within a team environment, I gained insights into effective communication and the importance of cohesive teamwork in achieving project goals. This endeavor not only expanded my technical expertise but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the iterative nature of engineering design and the continuous pursuit of innovative solutions in the face of real-world challenges.
