Hello, I'm Parsa, and I appreciate your time in reading my portfolio. Within these pages, you'll find a diverse showcase of my endeavors, ranging from coding and robotics to photography, fitness, and writing.

Currently in my penultimate year at the University of Adelaide, I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Engineering (Honours) with a focus on Mechanical Engineering, complemented by a Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences. My specialisation lies in mechatronics, with a profound fascination for the realm of artificial intelligence.

As a student, I thrive on the challenges presented by coding, design, and building. I'm enthusiastic about sharing my projects with you, each representing a unique facet of my interests.

Beyond the technical realm, I enjoy literature, bouldering, photography, and playing chess.
